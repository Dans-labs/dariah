About
=====

This is the Contribution tool of the [DARIAH ERIC](https://www.dariah.eu).

**Please note that this is a beta-version. The application is operational and
searchable, but not all data in it are curated. The tool is still under
development and you may experience slight changes in the lay-out and
functionalities, as well as temporal bugs or downtime. We will do our best to
keep the nuisance to a minimum and update the documentation as soon as possible
after changes have been applied.**
