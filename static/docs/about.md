### What is the DARIAH contribution tool?

This is a [system](/contrib) to assess the tools that have been contributed to the DARIAH infrastructure by its national members.
These tools constitute the in-kind contributions of the member states to the European DARIAH ERIC.
The purpose of the assessment is to establish the quality and value of the contributed tools.
It is important to know how much effort has gone into the creation, maintenance and delivery of the tool.
But also the satisfaction of the parties that use the tool are an important indicator of the value of the tool.

### Browse Contributions

The first step is to know what contributions are there, to oversee the landscape of contributions.

### Enter assessments

If you have contributed a tool, you start with writing a self-assessment.
This application will guide you through the relevant questions, depending on the type of your contribution.

### Review assessments
If you are a national coordinator or a delegate, you can review assessments, and add comments, and ultimately, assign a level.

### Engage in data analysis
This tool will contain valuable information for policy makers in science and education.
Here are your opportunities to mine that information, analyse it and visualize it.
