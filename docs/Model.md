This application contains a generic engine to display MongoDB data according to
any specified data model, respecting access privileges.

Data model
=============================================================================================
Both the
[data model]({{site.serverbase}}/models/data.YAML)
and the
[permission model]({{site.serverbase}}/models/permission.YAML)
are YAML configuration files, and by tweaking them you can achieve a lot of customization.
