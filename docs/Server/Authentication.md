# Authentication

Authentication on the production system is deferred to the DARIAH Identity Provider.

The server performs shibboleth authentication, with credentials coming from the
[DARIAH Identity provider]({{dariahIDP}})
.

??? abstract "`/login` `/logout` `/slogout`"
    The login/logout actions take place at the server after visiting `/login`,
    `/logout` or `/slogout`.

    ??? caution "Logout in two stages"
        Currently, `/logout` performs a logout from this app, but not from the DARIAH
        Identity Provider. To do the latter, one has to go to `/slogout` and close the
        browser.

## User records

When users log in, the details from DARIAH identity provider
will be stored in the user table.


??? explanation "Auto update"
    User details are stored upon every login.
    When the DARIAH identity provider has changed attributes of a user,
    these new attributes will be picked up and stored, replacing older values. 
    So the user table updates itself automatically.
    These updates reach our user table only for those
    users that actually log in, at the moment that they do log in.

??? explanation "Future users"
    The system may contain records for users that have never logged in. This happens
    when future users of the system are assigned to field values by their email
    address. Whenever such a user logs in, the attributes obtained during the
    authentication will flow into the incomplete user record if it exists, otherwise
    a new user record will be made. The new user will find him/herself in all places
    where his/her email address had been entered.

## Attributes

The systems maintains user-associated attributes from two sources:

??? explanation "Attributes from the DARIAH identity provider"
    user field in this app | attribute provided by DARIAH | comments
    ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------
    `eppn` | `eppn` | a string by which the user is identified in the DARIAH context
    `email` | `mail` | the email address according to the DARIAH identity provider
    `firstName` | `givenName` | 
    `lastName` | `sn` | 
    `name` | `cn` | common name, probably just `firstName lastName`
    `org` | `o` | organization to which the user is affiliated
    `membership` | `isMemberOf` | a semicolon separated string of groups within the DARIAH organization to which the user belongs, e.g. `lr_DARIAH-User`, `humanities-at-scale-contributors`, `dariah-eu-contributors`
    `rel` | `affiliation` | the type of relation the user has with DARIAH, such as `member@dariah.eu`

    ??? note "Ignored attributes"
        We do not use `unscoped-affiliation`, which is the `affiliation` without the
        `@dariah.eu` part.

??? explanation "Attributes generated by this app"
    user field | comments
    ---------- | --------
    `mayLogin` | whether the user is allowed to login. Default `true`, but the back office can use this field to prevent a user from logging in. When a user leaves, we advise to set `mayLogin` to `true`. It is not an option to delete a user, because (s)he can be the creator/modifier of records that are still in the system.
    `authority` | the basis on which the identity of the user has been established. See the values below.
    `group` | the permission level of this user. See the values below.
    `dateLastLogin` | when the user has logged in most recently
    `statusLastLogin` | whether the last login attempt was successful

    And, like almost all records in the system, some standard fields are added. You
    will not find these fields on the interface in most cases, but it is good to
    know that they will be recorded in the database.

    field | comments
    ----- | --------
    `creator` | the user that created this user record. The legacy user have `HaSProject` as creator, which is itself a user that cannot login. Other user records do not have a creator. So authenticated users cannot change their user records.
    `dateCreated` | when the record was created
    `modified` | a list of modification events, having the date of modification and the user who did it for each event.

??? explanation "Display of user attributes"
    When a user is presented on the interface, we choose between the following
    representations, in order of highest preference first.

    *   `name`, coming from the DARIAH attribute `cn` (common name)
    *   `firstName lastName`
    *   `email`
    *   `eppn-autority`

    We append `(org)` if available.

## Groups

When giving users permissions, the groups they are in play an important role.
The attributes `authority` and `group`  contain the necessary information.

??? explanation "`authority` values"
    authority | comments
    --------- | --------
    absent | the user has never been authenticated. Used for people that occur in the system, but have not yet logged in.
    `DARIAH` | the user has been logged in by the DARIAH identity provider
    `legacy` | the user has been imported from the FileMaker legacy data. This kind of user cannot log in.
    `local` | the user has logged in on the development system. This kind of user should not be present in the production system!

??? explanation "`group` values"
    group | comments
    ----- | --------
    `public` | unidentified users (the public). No right to edit anything. Can only list/read public information.
    `auth` | authenticated user. Can add items and then modify/delete them, within limits. Can see DARIAH internal information (within limits). This is the default group for logged-in users.
    `coord` | National coordinator. Can (de)select contributions and see cost fields. But only for contributions in his own country.
    `office` | back office users. Can modify records created by others (within limits). Cannot do system-technical things.
    `system` | system managers. Can modify system-technical records, within limits.
    `root` | Complete rights. Still there are untouchable things, that would compromise the integrity of the system. Even root cannot modify those.
    `nobody` | All powerful. You can also destroy the system. Fact: this group has no members.

    ???+ note "pseudo groups"
        Between `auth` and `coord` there are a few pseudo groups.
        These groups rely on a relationship between the user and a record in question.
        They are only in force if the user is authenticated.

        group | comments
        ----- | --------
        our | the user is mentioned in specific fields of the record. Which fields? See `ourFields` in the yaml file for that table, e.g. [assessment.yaml]({{serverBase}}/models/tables/assessment.yaml)
        edit | the user is mentioned in the `editors` field of the record 
        own | the user is the creator of the record

??? explanation "`statusLastLogin` values"
    statusLastLogin | comments
    --------------- | --------
    `Approved` | successful login attempt
    `Rejected` | unsuccessful login attempt

??? explanation "assigning users to groups"
    Once users are in a group, their permissions are known.
    But there are also permissions to regulate who may assign groups to users.
    These permissions derive from the groups as well,
    with a few additional rules:

    *   nobody can assign anybody to the group `nobody`;
    *   a person can only add people to groups that have at most his/her own power;
    *   a person can only assign groups to people that have less power than
        him/herself.

    Examples:

    *   If you are `office`, you cannot promote yourself or anyone else to `system` or
        `root`.
    *   If you are `office`, you cannot demote another member of `office` to the group
        `auth`.
    *   You cannot demote/promote your peers, or the ones above you.
    *   You can demote yourself, but not promote yourself.
    *   You can demote people below you.
    *   You can promote people below you, but only up to your own level.

??? explanation "the `root` group"
    A consequence of the promotion/demotion rules is
    that if there is no user in the group `root`, nobody can be made
    `root` from within the system.

    When importing data into the system by means of
    [load.sh]({{staticBase}}/tools/load.sh)
    you can specify to make a specific
    user `root`. Which user that is, is specified in
    [config.yaml]({{staticBase}}/tools/config.yaml)
    ,
    see `rootUser`.

    Once the root user is in place, (s)he can assign system admins and back office
    people. Once those are in place, the daily governance of the system can take
    place.
